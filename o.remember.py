You are playing a board game, everyone is controlling a robot together.
The robot will choose an action based the robot memory.
Summarize the robot memory in a few lines.
These lines will be added as your contribution to the robot memory.
You will pick {NUM_EDITS} lines to add.
Other players will also be adding lines.
Choose wisely such that your goals are achieved.
Your goals are: [{goal}]
Return a comma separated list of line numbers to add and remove.
The line numbers start at 0 and represent the row index.
